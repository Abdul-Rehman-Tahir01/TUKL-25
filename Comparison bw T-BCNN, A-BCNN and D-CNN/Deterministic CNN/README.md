# Deterministic CNN Active Learning and Training on AL data - Site B 2020 
This directory contains the Jupyter Notebooks for the AL of Deterministic CNN (D-CNN) and then the training of D-CNN on the whole AL data collected by T-BCNN, A-BCNN and deterministic CNN to compare between all three models.

## Requirements

* Pytorch 3.8.12 
* PyTorch 1.11.0

## File Structure

* <b>deterministic_CNN_AL_complete.ipynb</b>: Contains the implementation of AL techniques on the D-CNN model.
* <b>deterministic_CNN_evaluator_2ndcomplete.ipynb</b>: Contains the implementation of training and evaluation of the D-CNN model on the Active Learning data collected by the AL of T-BCNN, A-BCNN and Deterministic CNN.
* <b>all_final_results_det.xlsx</b>: Contains the final evaluation of all AL data on D-CNN model for comparison of which samples performed better on this model. An excel report.
